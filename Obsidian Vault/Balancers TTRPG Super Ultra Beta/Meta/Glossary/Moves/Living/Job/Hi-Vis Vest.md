If you need to convince someone that you belong somewhere, throw some engineering jargon at them and roll +[[Cognition]]. On a 10+ they believe you completely and will vouch for you if they’re questioned further. On a 7-9, they believe you, but need you to do something for them right now. On a 6 or less, they don’t believe you at all.
