When confronted with a complicated or dangerous situation, roll +[[Cognition]]. On a 10+, count 3. On a 7-9, count 1. Reduce your count by 1 to have the GM answer a question:

- What will hurt me or someone else?
- What are my points of entry?
- What are my points of egress?
- Where are there weak points?
- What am I not seeing?

On a 6 or less, the GM may ask you a question that you must answer honestly.
