Use your confidence to convince someone to do something for you. Roll +[[Assurance]]. On a 10+, they’ll do it. On a 7-9, they’ll do it, but you have to do something for them right now. On a 6 or less, they refuse to do what you ask, and may refuse to do things in the future— take -1 when trying to leverage this character in the future.
