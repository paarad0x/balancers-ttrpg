You have a TA you can call on to do tasks for you. If it’s something like covering for you at work, they’ll do it-- though if you call on them too often for this, they might start asking questions. If you need something big, roll +Cognition. On a 10+, they do what you want. On a 7-9, they need you to give them a reason to help. On a 6 or less, they’re done with you-- and if you piss them off enough, they’ll do something to hinder you.
