When something important is happening-- something that could be a historical event in the future, or something your living counterpart would tell you about when they’re a ghost-- describe what happens, then roll +[[Clarity]]. On a 10+, events unfold exactly as you describe. On a 7-9, you’re close, but you get an important detail wrong. On a 6 or less you’re completely wrong; move your [[Resonance]] value down 1.
