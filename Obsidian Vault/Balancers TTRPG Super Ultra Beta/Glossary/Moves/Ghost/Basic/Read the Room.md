Try to get a sense of something that happened here (dark) or will happen here (light). Roll +[[Clarity]]. On a 10+, count 3. On a 7-9, count 1. Reduce your count by 1 to answer a question:

- What dangerous thing was here/what dangerous thing will be here?
- Did someone die here/does someone die here?
- What was felt strongly here/what will be felt strongly here?
- What or who has been here/what or who will be here next?

On a 6 or less the GM picks at least one:

- You draw unwanted attention from someone
- You draw unwanted attention from something
- You strain your connection to your balancer; take -1 to your next [[Resonance]] roll.
