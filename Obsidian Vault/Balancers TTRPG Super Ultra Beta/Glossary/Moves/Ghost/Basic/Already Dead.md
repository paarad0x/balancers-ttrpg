When you would suffer Damage, instead roll +[[Connection]]. On a 10+, you shake it off. On a 7-9, it affects you, but you hold on; take -1 to your next roll. On a 6 or less, you can’t hold onto your form anymore; you and your living counterpart cannot take Balance Moves until you return. You automatically return at the end of a scene, but you can try to return sooner if you and your Balancer roll +[[Resonance]]. On a 12+, you come back. On an 8-11, you don’t come back, but nothing bad happens. On a 7 or less, your living counterpart strains themself, and takes -1 to their next roll. On a 4 or less, you cannot attempt to reform again and must wait until the end of the scene.
