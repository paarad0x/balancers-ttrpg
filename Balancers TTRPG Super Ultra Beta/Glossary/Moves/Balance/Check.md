Both Balancer and Ghost roll +[[Resonance]]. If their total roll is 12+, they know exactly where the Balance Scale is. On an 8-11, they know which direction the Balance Scale is skewed, but not how far. On a 5-7, they cannot tell how in or out of Balance the Balance Scale is. On a 4 or less, they make the Balance worse.
