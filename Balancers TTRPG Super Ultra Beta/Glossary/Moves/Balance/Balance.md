Both Balancer and Ghost roll +[[Resonance]]. If their total roll is 12+, the Balance Scale shifts to neutral. If their total is 8-11, the Balance Scale shifts one towards neutral. On a 5-7 the Balance Scale does not change. On a 4 or less, the Balance Scale worsens by 1.

Notes:
- more balancers = more movement?
- balance scale doesn't *worsen* on failure?
