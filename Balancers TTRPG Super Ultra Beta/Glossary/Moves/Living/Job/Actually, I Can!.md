Whenever someone tries to tell you that you can’t do something, tell them why you can. Roll +[[Assurance]]. On a 10+, they believe you; they might even help you. On a 7-9, you have to do a little more to get them to believe you. On a 6 or less, they not only don’t believe you, but they think you might be up to no good.
