Try to influence a person who can’t see you. Roll +Presence. On a 10+, pick two. On a 7-9, pick one.

- Write a word
- Send a feeling
- Make them aware of something
- Scare them

On a 6 or less, the GM picks one:

- They do something you don’t want
- The Balance shifts
- You strain your connection to your balancer; take -1 to your next [[Resonance]] roll.
