hello!! i'm griffin (aka paarad0x on discord) and i'm trying to adapt the premise of [Your Words Destroyed My Planet](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30391371/chapters/74926899) by [Unda](https://archiveofourown.org/users/Unda/pseuds/Unda) into a Powered by the Apocalypse-style TTRPG! this is still a super super SUPER work-in-progress but if you want to track progress, leave comments, make suggestions, or ask questions, this is one place to do it!

Q: what kind of TTRPG are we talking?

A: think sci-fi, space-faring, ghost hunt-y, mystery-y, cosmic horror-y!

Q: is that homestuck fanfiction in the year of our lord 2025?

A: yeah?? and????

Q: do i need to know anything about homestuck to play this?

A: not at all!! i'm planning to make the base game divorced from homestuck with optional homestuck add-ons

# Q: how do i use this thing??
# A: download the latest release, unzip it, and open the folder "Balancers TTRPG Super Ultra Beta" as an Obsidian Vault
